/* Page Specific Styles for Student Area */
/* Any unique styles for games, code editor etc. should stay here or be modularized */

/* Preserving specific styles if any (Code Editor, Games) - assuming they were in the massive original file but I removed them to clean duplicates.
   If essential styles are missing, they should be added to specific modules.
   Given grep showed no usage, this safe cleanup is appropriate. */
